    "In this module, we will explore how to apply reinforcement learning and decision-making models to behavior in social contexts. In this framework, individuals rely on **prediction errors** (the difference between the actual outcome and the expected outcome) from sampling different options or actions that yield either positive or negative outcomes. In this way, individuals learn **value associations** between actions/options and their outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the majority of studies examining reinforcement learning examine how individuals learn the association betwwen actions/options and outcomes that affect themselves alone, recent studies have begun to test how the this framework could be applied in social contexts (i.e., when people learn various associations ***from others*** ([Lindström, et al., 2019](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/10/4732)) and ***for others*** ([Lockwood, et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1603198113); [Lengersdorff, et al., 2020](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/40/38/7286)); or when people learn and update their beliefs ***about others*** ([Chang, et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010028510000150); [Siegel, et al., 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0425-1?WT.feed_name=subjects_social-science)).\n",

    "We will first review the model that best explained human behavior during a prosocial learning study, where individuals learned how their actions affected outcomes for **themselves**, a **stranger**, and **no one** ([Lockwood, et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1603198113)).\n",

    "They tested the following three models:\n",

    "### Rescorla-Wagner Model w/ six free parameters (3α3θ)\n",
    "\n",
    "Expectations of future reward for action $a$, ($Q_{t+1}^{a}$), should be a function of current expectations $Q_{t}^{a}$ and a prediction error, which is discrepancy between the actual reward that has just been experienced on this trial $r_t$ (coded as 1 or 0 for reward or no reward, respectively) and the expected reward for this trial $t$, ($Q_{t}^{a}$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_{t+1}^{a} = Q_{t}^{a} + \\alpha \\cdot (r_{t} - Q_{t}^{a})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the learning rate $\\alpha$ controls the extent to which the current expected value is updated by new information. A low $\\alpha$ minimizes the influence of the prediction error and the amount that the value is updated. The probability that a subject chooses action $a$ on trial $t$, given the expected values of the available actions $Q_{t}^{a}$, is given by the softmax function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_{t}(a | Q_{t}^{a}) = \\frac{\\exp(\\theta \\cdot Q_{t}^{a})}{\\sum_{a} \\exp(\\theta \\cdot Q_{t}^{a})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse temperature parameter $\\theta$ controls extent to which the subject decides to choose the most rewarding option versus exploring potentially more rewarding actions. The softmax function estimates the trial-by-trial probability of each action by weighting the ratio of expected values by $\\theta$. A low $\\theta$ would lead to similar action probabilities irrespective of the expected value of each action (resulting in random behavior). A high $\\theta$ would lead to consistent behavior, where the action with the higher expected value is invariably selected on each trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, separate $\\alpha$ and $\\theta$ parameters were estimated for each of the self, prosocial, and no one conditions. This resulted in six free parameters: $\\alpha_{Self}$, $\\alpha_{Social}$, $\\alpha_{NoOne}$, $\\theta_{Self}$, $\\theta_{Social}$, $\\theta_{NoOne}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Simple) Rescorla-Wagner Model w/ two free parameters (1α1θ)\n",
    "\n",
    "Expectations of future rewards followed the same criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_{t+1}^{a} = Q_{t}^{a} + \\alpha \\cdot (r_{t} - Q_{t}^{a})$$\n",

    "\n",
    "However, this model collapsed the $\\alpha$ and $\\theta$ parameters across each of the self, other, and no one conditions. This resulting in two free parameters: $\\alpha$, $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Null) Rescorla-Wagner Model (1θ)\n",
    "\n",
    "This model assumed random responding across trials, and thus did not assume learning. The value for $\\alpha$ was set to 0 (equivalent to no learning), and the value for $\\theta$ was varied between $0$ and $\\infty$."
