    "\n",
    "This study assessed whether social distancing behaviors (early in the COVID-19 pandemic) was associated with self-reported antisocial behavior. To measure one index of social distancing behavior, participants were presented with an image of an adult silhouette surrounded by a rectangular border. They were asked to click a point in the image that represents how far away they typically stood from other individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a heatmap showing how far participants reported standing from other individuals in the past week, with dark maroon indicating a higher density of responses obtained from a kernel density estimation. The mean response coordinate, +, represents a distance of approximately 98 inches (8.2 feet; 2.5 m).\n",
