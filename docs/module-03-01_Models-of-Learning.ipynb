If played on trial $t$, each slot machine, $k$, pays out a reward, $r_t$, which is `1` with reward probability, $\\mu^k_t$, and otherwise `0`. The reward probabilities are different for each slot machine and are initially unknown to the participant. In the simplest version of the task, the reward probabilities are fixed over time.\n",

    "Enter **Rescorla-Wagner**. As discussed in class, Rescorla and Wagner (in one of great papers of the 20th Century) proposed that learning occurs when there is a prediction error. In their model, participants first learn the expected value of each slot machine based on the history of previous outcomes and then use these values to make a decision about what to do next. A simple model of learning is the Rescorla-Wagner learning rule (Rescorla & Wagner, 1972) whereby the value of option $k$, $Q^k_t$ is updated in response to reward $r_t$ according to:\n",

For simplicity, we assume that the initial value, $Q^k_0=0$, although it is possible to treat the $Q^k_0$ as a free parameter of the model (this is also the intercept).\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple model of decision making is to assume that participants use the options' values to guide their decisions, choosing the most valuable option most frequently, but occasionally making 'mistakes' (or exploring) by choosing a low value option. One choice rule with these properties is known as the **'softmax' choice rule**, which chooses option $k$ with probability:\n",
