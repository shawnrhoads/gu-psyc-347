# Final Project Guidelines

Determining a research question and coming up with a study to answer the question is an iterative process. It is a multi-step process that requires constant feedback from peers/advisors.

The final project will serve as a smaller-scale example of the steps involved in creating a research study, and will assess your cumulative comprehension of the course material and application to your own research ideas/interests. It comprises four parts:
1. Project Proposal - Round 1 (25 points)
2. Annotated Bibliography (25 points)
3. Project Proposal - Round 2 (75 points)
4. Project Presentation (80 points)

### Project Proposal - Round 1
Students will submit a 250-300 word abstract describing their research question, hypotheses, and study idea along with an outline of the relevant content (i.e., summary of points for the following sections: Introduction, Experimental Design, Intellectual Merit, Broader Impacts, and Conclusion). They should set up a meeting with the instructor (during office hours) to determine a final project. Upon completion of this assignment, students will receive feedback and suggestions on how to improve their study and should incorporate this feedback into their proposal (Round 2).

### Annotated Bibliography
Students will choose 7-10 research articles and summarize the research questions, methods, and results of each paper (behavior only). Students should also include a 2-3 sentences on each paper's relevance to their final project.

### Project Proposal - Round 2
Students will expand their 250-300 word abstract based on feedback from the instructor. Their project proposal should be 2-3 pages in [NSF GRFP Research Proposal format](http://nsfgrfp.org/) (see resources and examples: [1](https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship), [2](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/nsf-research-proposal/), [3](http://www.malloryladd.com/nsf-grfp-advice.html); [see template document](https://github.com/shawnrhoads/gu-psyc-347/raw/master/docs/static/templates/NSFGRFP_ResearchPlanTemplate.docx) on a hypothetical research study. This should include:
1. Introduction
2. Research Aims
3. Hypotheses
4. Experimental Design
5. Intellectual Merit
6. Broader Impacts
7. Conclusion
8. References

### Project Presentation
This presentation will be the "final exam" of this course. Students will present their project proposal to the class (5-8 minutes each) and determine 2-3 questions for a quick class discussion (3 minutes).
