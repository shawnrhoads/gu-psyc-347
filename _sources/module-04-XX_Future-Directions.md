# Future Directions

Thanks for making it to the end of this Jupyter Book! I hope you found these course materials helpful! Although the covered topics are not exhaustive or comprehensive, I encourage checking out this [growing list of literature](https://shawnrhoads.github.io/gu-psyc-347/module-00-03_Reading-List.html) that extends beyond the purview of the course. 

Contributions from the community to extend the breath and depth of tutorials are most welcome! These extensions may include improving or expanding existing content (e.g., stylistic improvements, alternative optimization algorithms), adding new tutorials on topics covered throughout the course, or adding new tutorials on related topics not covered throughout the course. Here are some tutorials on computational models of human social behavior and neuroscience that I hope to add in the future! These topics were covered in the original course via lectures, readings, and discussions, but not implemented in the Jupyter Book.

* Model-based versus model-free learning in social contexts
* Learning about the states/beliefs of others
* Game Theory
* Interactive Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (iPOMDPs)
* Integrating personal and social information (e.g., social evidence accumulation)
* All topics with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data
