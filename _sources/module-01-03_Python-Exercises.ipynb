    "# Python Exercises\n",
    "For our first exercise, we will apply some of the skills we learned in Python. Please use all of the resources available to you, including Google, StackOverflow, and the Canvas Discussion Board.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these exercises, we will be using data from [O'Connell, K., Berluti, K., Rhoads, S. A., & Marsh, A. A. (2021). Reduced social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with antisocial behaviors in an online United States sample. PLoS ONE.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0244974)\n",
    "\n",
    "This study assessed whether social distancing behaviors (early in the COVID-19 pandemic) was associated with self-reported antisocial behavior. To measure one index of social distancing behavior, participants were presented with an image of an adult silhouette surrounded by a rectangular border. They were asked to click a point in the image that represents how far away they typically stood from other individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a heatmap showing how far participants reported standing from other individuals in the past week, with dark maroon indicating a higher density of responses obtained from a kernel density estimation. The mean response coordinate, +, represents a distance of approximately 98 inches (8.2 feet; 2.5 m).\n",
